The aim of this was to be able to control an LED with a potentiometer, a dsPIC30F4011 and the MPLAB X IDE for my Microcontroller Application Group Lab (MAGL) module at university.

The skills gained in from this project went on to be used to a read sensor data in small robot built to complete in a micromouse-style challenge.
